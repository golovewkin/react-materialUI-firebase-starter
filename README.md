## When You need it
When you want to create a small project really quickly and you don't want complications with deploy and hosting.
This project works as a static website after you build it

## What is inside
React 18, material ui, firebase auth, firebase firestore with NO SERVER CODE (just 2 scripts ðŸ˜‰)

## What you will get:
1. Easy hosting (Digital Ocean, for example)
2. Admin panel
3. Mini Entity framework with ability to save to firebase
4. 'Settings' and 'Home' page for users
5. Users can login via email ONLY in this version
6. Reset password functionality out of the box
7. Landing page template
8. Now it uses Firebase as a db, but there could be any requests to any DB or via HTTP and switching should go smoothly


##  Steps to launch the project (Yes, it's a little complicated ðŸ¥º):

1. Clone the project
2. Create a firebase project
3. Create Auth project inside your firebase project and set providers (email and Google)
4. Create web app in your firebase project and get credentials (it's in project settings)
    1. Put your credentials in .env.example and rename it to .env
    2. Create firestore database storage
5. Change title in index.html and favicons
6. Change name in package.json and manifest.json
7. Get a server config from firebase (Project settings -> server config ->generate new private key)
8. Put your credential to /config/config.json considering config.example.json as an example
9. run script to create an admin (after npm i):
   1. node admin-create-script.js your-email 
   2. Get your admin data id
   3. Setup firestore rules (see firebase.rules.example)
10. npm start
11. How to create a user (3 ways)
    1. Admin creates a user via script (node user-create-script.js user-email)
    2. Via a user request
       1. User sends a request
       2. Admin approves it
       3. Admin creates a user via script (node user-create-script.js user-email)
       4. Admin send credentials to a user (any way)
    3. Via an admin invite (the most dangerous, doesn't work right now because of Firebase restrictions)
       1. Admin creates an invitation
       2. It gives you a link
       3. Admin should give it to the user
       4. User can create an account with this link
12. Setup your landing page
13. Setup Firebase Cloud Storage if you want to store images
14. Deploy to Digital Ocean or a similar service

## Note
This project is just a starting point, you can change/add yourself:
1. Typescript
2. Login with Google provider
3. Google recaptcha but it requires a server or cloud functions. Maybe Firebase reCAPTCHA?
4. Pagination in data queries
5. An email service for users creation
6. Better accessibility
